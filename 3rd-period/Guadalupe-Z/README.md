# Final Portfolio Project – Guadalupe Z.

## 👋 About Me

Hi! My name is Guadalupe Z., and I’m a hardworking and goal-driven student developer. I’m passionate about doing well in school, reaching for my dreams, and making my immigrant parents proud. I plan to become a doctor one day and hope to attend either Stanford or UC Davis. I enjoy playing soccer — I’ve proudly served as team captain for two years — and I use sports and coding as ways to express myself, lead others, and keep pushing forward. 💪⚽

## 💻 About This Project

This portfolio project is the final assignment for my web development class. Over the course of this year, I learned how to build websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I learned how to plan, code, design, and bring my creative ideas to life using web technologies. This project showcases everything I’ve worked on and learned, and it represents how much I’ve grown as a student and future developer.
