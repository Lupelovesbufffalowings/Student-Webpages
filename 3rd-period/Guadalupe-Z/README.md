# Final Portfolio Project – Guadalupe Z.

## 👋 About Me

Hi! My name is Guadalupe Z., and I’m a student developer who is passionate about learning, achieving goals, and making my family proud. I dream of becoming a doctor one day and attending Stanford or UC Davis. I enjoy using creativity and problem-solving skills through coding, and I’ve developed strong leadership as a two-year soccer team captain. I approach everything I do with dedication and heart — both on the field and in the classroom.

## 📚 About This Project

This project is the final portfolio for my web development class. Throughout this year, I’ve learned how to code using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’ve built multiple projects that helped me grow as a developer, and I’m proud to showcase what I’ve created. This portfolio is the result of hard work, creativity, and new technical skills that I will continue to build upon in the future.
