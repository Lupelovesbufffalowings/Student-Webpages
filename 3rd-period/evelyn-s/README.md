## About Me
Hi! I'm Evelyn, a student developer with a passion for building thoughtful, engaging digital experiences. Throughout the school year I have created a solid foundation in web development, I've learned how to create my ideas into actual functioning projects.

## About My Website
This portfolio encapsules all the things I've learned this year. It shows my growth as a developer and how I've explored the path of planning and designing projects. This website helped me further elevate my designing skills by challenging me to create a new fresh and modern look to a website. I was able to practice my problem-solving skills and learn how to showcase my work professionally.
