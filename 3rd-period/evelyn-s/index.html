      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is Evelyn Sanchez. I have 2 birds, Dinky and BuBu, and a cat named Luna. I enjoy hiking, the summertime, and the rain. I'm passionate about art and love making ceramic pieces, pen-pal cards, and collecting cute sticker sheets. My favorite store is Daiso. I plan to study civil engineering in college.</p>

      <h2>What I Learned in Computer Science</h2>
      <p>This year, I learned how to use loops to repeat tasks, arrays to store data, and functions/voids to organize my code. I practiced using conditional statements to make decisions, used "break" to exit loops early, and learned how to sort data with bubble sort. These skills helped me think logically and build fun, interactive projects, such as the ones shown below.</p>
