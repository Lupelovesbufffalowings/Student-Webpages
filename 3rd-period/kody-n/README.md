# Final Portfolio Project – Kody N

## About Me

Hi! I'm Kody N, I am a junior at Mt.Eden High School who is learning about computer science. Throughout the year, I have learned how to use multiple programming languages and structure them accordingly. In my furture I plan to go to UC San Diego to major in some sort of engineering but I'm not sure yet. But my main priority right now is get A's in my classes because summer is coming up and I want to be GONE.

## About This Project

This portfolio is the culmination of my work throughout the year as a web development student. It not only showcases the projects I’ve created, but also represents the growth I’ve experienced as a developer. Through this process, I learned how to plan, build, and deploy full-featured websites, apply responsive design principles, write clean and maintainable code, and use version control effectively with Git and GitHub.

## What My Portfolio Includes

- A responsive and accessible design
- A clean, user-friendly layout showcasing my best work
- Links to live demos and source code for each featured project
- A brief bio and contact information
- Organized and semantic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code

## Featured Projects

### 1. **Pong Game**
This game was my first project for this class. I followed a YouTube tutorial on how to make the pong arcade game using strictly HTML and Java.

### 2. **Cookie Clicker**
This was the third project for this class and it was a group assignment. We were not allowed to follow any tutorials and had limited outside help. This game is a cookie clicker replica with ranks and upgrades like an autoclicker and double clicks, all created using HTML, CSS, and Java.

### 3. **Guess the Number Game**
This game was my final project for this class and was completed solo without outside help. I used HTML, CSS, and Java to make this game and turned it into the College Board. When playing, there are two separate game modes: one where you can pick the secret number, and one where it is computer-generated. After you guess a random number from 1-100, it will tell you whether it is higher or lower until the correct number is submitted..
