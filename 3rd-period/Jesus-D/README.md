# Jesus D
👋 About Me Hi, I'm Jesus Delgado, a high school student passionate about computer science and web development. My programming journey began with C++, where I developed a solid understanding of logic and structure. Since then, I’ve branched into frontend development, exploring HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create engaging and interactive web experiences. I love building projects that challenge my creativity and sharpen my problem-solving skills.

📚 Project Overview This portfolio is a showcase of my growth as a developer throughout the school year. Each project reflects the skills I’ve gained working with core web technologies and applying concepts like responsive design, dynamic interactivity, and clean code organization. Through these projects, I’ve learned how to turn simple ideas into fully functional web apps.

🚀 Featured Projects 🦖 Dino Game My version of the classic Google dinosaur game with a personal twist. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this endless runner challenges the player to jump over obstacles and avoid collisions. It features smooth animation, score tracking, and keyboard controls.

🃏 Mix and Match Card Game A fun and memory-testing game where players flip over cards to find matching pairs. I built this project to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic. It includes randomized card placement and a simple win condition to keep players engaged.

💻 Code Generator A handy tool that creates random secure passwords or snippets of code based on user input. This project helped me work with JavaScript string functions, form inputs, and user-friendly UI design. It’s both practical and a great way to dive deeper into logic-based programming.
