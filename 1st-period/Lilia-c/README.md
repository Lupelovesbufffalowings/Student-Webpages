Hi, I‚Äôm Lilia C, a student developer. Over the course of my studies, I‚Äôve built a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I‚Äôm continuously learning to grow as a developer. My portfolio showcases the skills I've developed and the progress I've made throughout the year.

## Project Summary

This portfolio is the culmination of my learning and development over the past academic year. It represents my journey as a developer and includes a variety of projects that highlight my growth, creativity, and technical skills. Through building this site, I gained a deeper understanding of responsive design, version control, and the importance of clean, maintainable code.
