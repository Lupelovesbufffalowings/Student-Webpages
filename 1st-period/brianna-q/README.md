👋 About Me

Hi, I'm Brianna Quach, a junior in high school with a growing passion for computer science and web development. I started my journey with C++, which gave me a strong foundation in programming logic. Over the past year, I’ve expanded into frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoy building interactive web projects and continually pushing myself to learn new skills as I grow as a developer.

📚 Project Overview

This portfolio project is the culmination of everything I’ve learned in computer science this school year. It features a collection of my favorite web-based projects, built using core web technologies. Throughout the process, I gained hands-on experience with responsive design, JavaScript interactivity, and structuring clean, readable code. Each project helped me improve my problem-solving skills and taught me how to bring creative ideas to life on the web.

🖥️ What's in My Portfolio?

My portfolio website acts as a central hub for showcasing my best work. It includes:

- An "About Me" section introducing who I am and what I’ve learned  
- Project descriptions and visuals for each featured project  
- Links to live versions of each project for visitors to explore  

🧩 Featured Projects
🎯 Hangman
A classic word-guessing game where players try to reveal a hidden word letter by letter before running out of chances.

🔐 Password Generator
Creates secure, randomized passwords based on user-selected criteria like length and character types. Great for practicing form handling and string manipulation.

🍪 Fortune Cookie
Generates a random fortune each time the cookie is "opened." A fun way to practice DOM interaction and randomization.

🟡 Flappy Ball
An arcade-style game inspired by Flappy Bird, where players tap to keep the ball afloat while avoiding obstacles.

♠️ Black Jack
A browser-based card game where players compete against the dealer to hit 21 without going over. Includes scoring logic and interactive controls.---
