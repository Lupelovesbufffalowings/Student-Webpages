# Khryzti F.

hello!! my name is khryzti, and I started coding this school year. I've always been interested in math/STEM, so I thought this computer science class would be fun!!!

over this school year, I have learned about the basics and principles of coding — from variables to functions — and how the internet works (IP addresses, domains, routers, etc.), along with learning the basics of coding. I also learned many languages such as C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Scratch. using these languages, guidance from the class, and my knowledge of coding, I created these projects throughout the school year ^_^  
this project is one big organized portfolio to showcase them!
