        <div class="pOne">
         <h2><a href="todo.html">To Do List</a></h2>
            <p>In this project I made a To-Do List that allows you to add stuff. One click strikes though the actual text and then a duble click deletes it completly</p>

      <div class="pFour">
        <h2><a href="block.html">Blockbreaker</a></h2>
        <p>In this game the objective is to try to break as many bricks as you can using the paddle and the walls to bounce off of. If you touch the ground you lose a life, you get a total of three lives in the beginning. The game continues infinitely until there are no lives left.</p>
