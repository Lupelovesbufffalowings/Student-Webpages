# Final Portfolio Project ‚Äì BMS

## About Me

Hi, I'm BMS, a student developer passionate about building interactive and user-friendly web applications. Over the past year, I‚Äôve focused on learning the fundamentals of web development, honing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and growing as a creative problem-solver. I'm always excited to take on new challenges and explore innovative ways to bring ideas to life through code.

## About This Project

This final portfolio project represents the culmination of my work and learning throughout the year. It's a personal website designed to showcase my development journey, the projects I've built, and the skills I've developed. Through this project, I‚Äôve gained valuable experience in designing for the web, debugging code, and applying responsive design principles. More importantly, I‚Äôve learned how to think like a developer ‚Äî to plan, iterate, and adapt.

## Portfolio Overview

My portfolio site is a single-page application styled with responsive design in mind. It features custom HTML and CSS, interactive JavaScript elements, and clear, accessible navigation. It serves as a living document of my growth as a developer and includes links to some of my most meaningful projects.

## Featured Projects

### 1. **Breakout-Style Game**
A fun, browser-based game built using HTML Canvas and JavaScript. Players control a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks, with increasing difficulty as the game progresses. This project taught me about game loops, collision detection, and canvas rendering.

### 2. **Responsive Personal Blog Layout**
A simple but effective blog layout that adapts to different screen sizes. I used media queries and a mobile-first approach to ensure it looks great on both desktop and mobile. This project helped reinforce responsive design techniques.

### 3. **Weather App**
A web application that fetches real-time weather data from a public API based on user input. I learned how to work with APIs, handle asynchronous JavaScript (using `fetch` and Promises), and dynamically update the DOM based on user interactions.

### 4. **Portfolio Website (This Project)**
The main site itself ‚Äî fully coded by me ‚Äî brings all of my projects together in one place. It includes interactive sections, a clean design, and navigation that reflects thoughtful structure and usability.
